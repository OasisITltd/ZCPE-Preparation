<!-- PHP Manual > Language Reference > Types -->
<pre>
PHP supports eight primitive types.

Four scalar types:

boolean
integer
float (floating-point number, aka double)
string
Two compound types:

array
object
And finally two special types:

resource
NULL
This manual also introduces some pseudo-types for readability reasons:

mixed
number
callback (aka callable)
array|object
void
And the pseudo-variable $....

Some references to the type "double" may remain in the manual. Consider double the same as float; the two names exist only for historic reasons.

The type of a variable is not usually set by the programmer; rather, it is decided at runtime by PHP depending on the context in which that variable is used.
